#### News
<strong style="color:red;"><strong>I’m actively applying for a research intern position in 2025 Summer and a long-time member position in the Lab from Rutgers Faculty(Any department). </strong></strong> If you need a student who is familiar with <strong style="color:red;"><strong>Computer Vision</strong></strong>, feel free to <a href="#contact-info">Contact Me</a>!


#### Biography
I am an incoming 2nd-year transfer Undergraduate Student pursuing a bachelor's Degree in computer science at School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Now, I do the research under [Ce Zheng](https://zczcwh.github.io/). I have experience in Computer Vision, mainly focus on the Human Pose Estimation and Human Mesh Recovery. Currently, I am continuously studying digital human model likes SMPL, SKEL and so on.


#### Research Interests
My current passion revolves around building a more realistic and kinematic digital human model under much unlabeled and high-quality data, this includes: 
1. **Human Pose Estimation**：A process of detecting human body positions and key points within an image or video.
2. **Digital Human**：A computer-generated representation of a human being, capable of simulating realistic human appearance, movements, and interactions within digital environments.
3. **Data-Centric AI**：Emphasizes the importance of high-quality, diverse, and well-managed data to train robust AI models that can make reliable inferences and decisions.
